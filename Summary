The given code that performs web scraping and text processing tasks.
The program first crawls a website (https://keras.io/api/) and collects all the URLs present on the website by parsing the HTML using the BeautifulSoup library. 
It then writes the list of URLs to a text file named "keras.txt".
The program then reads the contents of "keras.txt" and removes any URLs that point to PDF or Python files.
It then reads the remaining URLs one by one and uses the langchain library to perform text processing tasks.
The langchain library is used to load the web pages content and split them into smaller chunks of text. 
Then the text is converted to embeddings using the HuggingFace library, and the embeddings are stored in a FAISS index. Finally, the program saves the FAISS index
and the vectors store object to disk for further use.
